# Flat-Out Mangagement

Kia ora!
Welcome to the Flat-Out Mangement Github Page. If you've stumbled here looking for a _**user manual**_, or _**technical notes**_, they can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/HonsonCooky/Flat-Out-Management/wiki) 

### What is Flat-Out Management?
Flat-Out Management (FOM) is a cross-platform application, that aims to assist flatting groups with managerial tasks. The application can be used for automatic chore lists, shopping lists, group calanders, and much more. It was designed with for flatties, by flatties. See the [_**user manual**_](https://github.com/HonsonCooky/Flat-Out-Management/wiki/User-Manual) if you'd like to understand how to use the application.

### For the open source community
Firstly, you're awesome! I really appreciate the time and effort that this community puts into making sure that developers are well informed. I've saved countless amounts of hours because of the generosity of this community. I hope this project helps someone else overcome some challenges. So, thank-you.

This is a personal project that I'm sharing with you such that others have an example of how to create a hobbiest level application. An application that utilizes _**USERS, GROUPS, NOSQL TABLES, PROFILE PICTURES,**_ and more. I'm aware that there are many examples of flutter, heroku and mongodb applications out there, but I've decided to collect all my ideas into one place and document them.

I'm always happy to have my code critiqued, and I welcome that from everyone, (newbies and experts). Doesn't matter if it's half a nano-second of saved time, or several lines that could be changed to one. If you find something to make this code better, I'd love to hear your opinions. (Bare in mind, I have opinions of my own, and will happily discuss ideas if they're related to the project. I'm happy to comment alternative code implementations with their benefits, into the source code).

This repository is a mono-repo for the entire project. The `flat_out_api` is an Express + MongoDB backend (utilizing the hobbiest-tier that those PAAS's provide), and the `flat_out_app` is a Flutter frontend.

This README has little information to offer beyond an introduction to the project. See the [_**technical notes**_](https://github.com/HonsonCooky/Flat-Out-Management/wiki/Technical-Design-and-Implementation) in the wiki if you'd like an in-depth understanding of the over engineered design, helpful tips and tricks to working with Heroku and MongoDB on a hobbiest level, and much more.

For those who dislike comments with a passion, I'd like to apologies in advance. My memory fails me at the best of times, and I want to pass on information in as many methods as possible. My code has been commented to kingdom come.
