# Flat-Out Mangagement ðŸ“‹

## Project Overview and Personal Statements ðŸ“¢

Flat-Out Management (FOM) is an application to help with automation and communication of flat managerial tasks. From tracking chores, to keeping game-night scores; FOM aims to be a tool to remove some of the stresses that flatting may bring.

For full transparency, this application was designed and created for _**fun**_. The base program itself, aims to resolve the issue outlined above, however, some addition features are those which seemed fun to attempted/learn (i.e. the inclusion of profile pictures). FOM is the second attempt to resolve issues that I've encountered during my time as a flatmate. The previous version no longer exists, as it was a botched program, created in one week, to immediately resolve one issue. This version aims to be more generic.

Having a full time job, and a large student debt, this project is designed and created at the hobbiest level ([see more here](https://github.com/HonsonCooky/Flat-Out-Management/tree/main/flat_out_api)). As such, the performance and engineering of this application has majorly been designed around being 'no cost'. Feedback and ideas more than welcome, please leave comments as 'issues' in this git repository. 

## What can FOM do? ðŸ“±
FOM is a cross-platform application to resolve some of the flatting issues I've encountered (and some I thought might be encountered). 

Some example of things that can be done:
- A chore list that automatically rotates week to week.
- A notification reminder to put out the rubbish, the night before.
- Flat shopping lists shared between everyone.
- Group calander, where everyone's schedules are combined.
- The ability to assign 'associations' to the flat, such that partners, landlords, and friends can view the schedule of the flat.

The application can do so much more, [see here](https://github.com/HonsonCooky/Flat-Out-Management/tree/main/flat_out_app)
