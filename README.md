# Flat-Out Mangagement ðŸ“‹

Flat-Out Management (FOM) is a cross-platform application, that aims to assist flatting groups with managerial tasks.<br/>
This is a fun little side project that I (HonsonCooky) decided to take on due to issues I've experienced.<br/>
In general, the automation of chores, to keeping game-night scores, FOM is designed to remove some of the admin work that comes with running a flat.<br/> 
Maybe this application is just what you need to get your household back on track.<br/>
Designed for anyone looking to make working with others to maintain a household easier.
