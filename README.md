# Flat-Out Mangagement

Welcome to the Flat-Out Mangement Github Page. If you've stumbled here looking for a _**user manual**_, or _**technical notes**_, they can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/HonsonCooky/Flat-Out-Management/wiki) 

Flat-Out Management (FOM) is a cross-platform application, that aims to assist flatting groups with managerial tasks. In general, the application can be used for maintaining any sort of household, but it was designed with flatting groups in mind.<br/>

This repository is a mono-repo for the entire project. `flat_out_api` is the Express + MongoDB backend for the project, and `flat_out_app` is the Flutter frontend. 

In general, my code has been commented, but it has not been designed for usage outside of this application. So this README has little information to offer. See the technical notes in the wiki if you'd like to understand my thought processes, and learnings. See the user manual if you'd like to understand how to use the application.
