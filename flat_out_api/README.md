# Flat Out Mangement Technical Document

Kia Ora! 
This page will outline how the program was built, and outlines the things that I have learnt when building this application (both backend and frontend). 
If you are looking for how to use the application, [go here](https://github.com/HonsonCooky/Flat-Out-Management/tree/main/flat_out_app).

_**Warning 01:**_ This document includes discussions of the technical details of the Flat-Out Mangement application. I've attempted to link to relevant information where possible. Feel free to post questions as 'issues' in this git repository., and I will update the documentation when possible. 

_**Warning 02:**_ This is a personal project. If you are looking for answers to your enterprise level application, maybe, just maybe, _Stack Overflow_ is a better place to search for answers. 

## Design
Let's be honest here, no personal project _really_ has a design when they're started. So, maybe the following design might help you with your personal project. As a personal project, we are looking for solutions at the hobbiest level (free). So lets get right into the mess of it.
